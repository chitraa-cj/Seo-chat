# FastAPI Module Import Troubleshooting (2025-03-25 00:14:40)

_**Assistant**_

I notice you're trying to run a FastAPI application using uvicorn but encountering a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'` error. This typically happens when Python can't find the module in its path, even though you've set the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

Let me check the project structure to better understand how to help you.

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory • **7** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `.env` |
| 📁 `seoAgent` |
| 📄 `.DS_Store` |
| 📁 `.git` |
| 📁 `frontend` |
| 📁 `backend` |
| 📁 `.next` |

</details>

I see that your project structure is different from what the command expects. The command is trying to run `src.app:app`, but I don't see a `src` directory in your project. Instead, I see `backend` and `frontend` directories.

Let me check the backend directory to find the correct path to your FastAPI application:


---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory backend • **8** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `src` |
| 📄 `.env` |
| 📄 `package.json` |
| 📁 `dist` |
| 📄 `tsconfig.json` |
| 📁 `prisma` |
| 📄 `package-lock.json` |
| 📁 `node_modules` |

</details>

---

I see the issue now. You need to run the command from the `backend` directory since that's where your FastAPI application is located. Here's what you should do:

1. First, change to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Then run the uvicorn command:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD uvicorn src.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Let me help you run this command:

I see the command was rejected. Let me check if there are any Python dependencies that need to be installed first. Let me look for a requirements.txt file:


---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory backend/src • **7** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `index.ts` |
| 📄 `client.ts` |
| 📁 `routes` |
| 📁 `middleware` |
| 📁 `utils` |
| 📁 `config` |
| 📁 `models` |

</details>

I notice that this appears to be a TypeScript project rather than a Python project. The files are `.ts` files, not `.py` files. This suggests that the backend is actually a Node.js/TypeScript application, not a FastAPI application.

Let me check the package.json to confirm this:


---

Read file: backend/package.json

---

I see the issue now. This is actually a Node.js/Express application, not a FastAPI application. The command you were trying to run was for a Python FastAPI application, but your backend is written in TypeScript using Express.

To run the backend, you should use:

```bash
cd backend
npm install  # Only needed first time to install dependencies
npm run dev  # This will start the development server
```

Let me help you run this:


---

```bash
cd backend && npm install && npm run dev
```

```
